=============================================================================

Module "TRIG_US_front" (component BitIO_LDD)
   - TRIG_US_front_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors 
                and sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" 
                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - TRIG_US_front_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, 
                interrupts vectors, etc.
   - TRIG_US_front_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - TRIG_US_front_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value 
                to a memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - TRIG_US_front_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - TRIG_US_front_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "TU_US_front" (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU_US_front_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU_US_front_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - TU_US_front_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down

                counter.
